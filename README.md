A Scheme Shell Script for Updating Software
===========================================

This is a script for [the Scheme Shell][scsh] (scsh) which I use to
update software on my computer—that is, software for which I do not
use my operating system’s package manager.  There are a number of
programs I use, mostly for software development, which I want to
update more frequently than official packages keep up with.  I am
publishing this script not because I expect most of you to find it
useful, but because I want to demonstrate how [Scheme][] is a viable
programming language for shell scripting.
